Tic-Tac-Toe with React

Submission by Vlad-Ioan Durdeu

Introduction

This was my first real project with React. I built it by following the official React tutorial, just to get a real feel for how components, props, and state actually work. Simple goal: build something that runs, understand how the pieces fit together, and not just read about it.

It might just be a Tic-Tac-Toe game, but it taught me a lot about building apps the right way.
